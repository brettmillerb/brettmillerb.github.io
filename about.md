### Why a blog?
I constantly take notes when I am completing a task as so I figured that I would take notes in a concise and ordered manner as opposed to what is currently in my OneNote, Trello, physical notepad, Skype conversation history, email sent items and other places I may have tried over the past few years.

I will be mainly posting about stuff that I am interested in so Powershell, Windows Server Administration tasks, other technology that I use or play with and probably some music too. But most importantly this will likely serve as reference material to aid my ever decaying memory.

### A little bit about me
I have worked in IT around 10 years and have been a System Administrator for around 3 of those years. I began learning Powershell as a means to automate dull tasks, mainly around Active Directory, and I caught the bug. I now spend most of my day either in VSCode or a Powershell console in some way shape or form.

I have no previous scripting experience or background in other languages so my posts may not be grammatically or technically correct so please feel free to correct me, ridicule me or educate me but most importantly, I hope someone finds something useful in these posts.
